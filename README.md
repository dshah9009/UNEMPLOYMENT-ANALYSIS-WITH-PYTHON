# UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

This project analyzes unemployment rates across different regions and states in India. The data used in this analysis comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

## Data

The 'Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv' file contains monthly unemployment rates for each state from January 1976 to November 2020. The file includes columns for the state, date, frequency, unemployment rate, employment level, employment-population ratio, region, longitude, and latitude.

## Analysis

The data was cleaned and summarized to compute mean unemployment rates by region. Two visualizations were created using the cleaned data:

- A histogram of unemployment rates by region
- A sunburst chart of unemployment rates by state and region

## Results

The histogram shows that unemployment rates have generally been highest in the West and South regions, and lowest in the Northeast region. The sunburst chart allows us to see the unemployment rates for each state, as well as how they are grouped by region.

## Usage

To use this project, simply download the 'Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv' file and run the Python script provided in this repository. The script requires Python 3 and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
